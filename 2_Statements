###if/elif/else

Syntax-
if statement:
  print('')
 elif statement:
  print('')
 else
  print('')
  
 **we can have as many elif statement as we want
 
 ###For Loops
 Many objects in python are iterable meaning we can iterate over every element in object
 we can iterate over every char in string, every item in list, every key in a dictionary
 Syntax-
============================================ 
 for item in object:
    statements to do stuff
============================================    
    
 my_iterable = [1,2,3]
 for item_name in my_iterable:
  print(item_name)

**using for loop we can unpack tuples pair in list. 
  e.g.
  mylist = [(1,2),(3,4),(5,6)]
  for item in mylist:
    print(item)
  ===============================
  for a,b in mylist:
    print(a)
    print(b)
**By default, when we iterate through a dictionary. We only iterate through the keys.
  to get value we have to use variable_name.items():
  e.g.
  d = {'k1':1,'k2':2,'k3':3}
  for item in d.items():
      print(item)
  for (key,value) in d.items():
      print(key,value)
      
###While loop
while loop will continue to execute a block of code while some condition remains true.
e.g. while my pool is not full, keep filling my pool with water or while my dogs are still hungry, keep feeding my dogs.

Syntax:
while some_boolean_conditions:
    #do something
    
combine with else statement-
while some_boolean_conditions:
    do something
else:
    do something different
    
**break- breaks out of the current closest enclosing loop.
  continue-goes to the top of the closest enclosing loop.
  pass- does nothing at all. when we dont want to execute for/while loop
  
**Useful Operators-
1) Range- range(start,STOP,step)
      The range function allows us to quickly generate a list of integers
      There are 3 parameters you can pass, a start, a stop, and a step size.
      This is a generator fn. so to actually get a list out of it, we need to cast it to a list with list()
      What is a generator? Its a special type of function that will generate information and not need to save it to memory.
2)Enumerate- It will count index automatically in the form of tuples
            word = 'abcde'
            for letter in enumerate(word):
                print(letter)
3) Zip - zip together two lists
         It will go and zip together as far as the list is the shortest
         
4) In 
5) Min/Max
6) random library- Python comes off with built in library. There are tons of fn included in this library.
    e.g. from random import shuffle (Here, we are importing shuffle from lib)
         from random import gradint (To grab a random integer)
7) input function- It always takes string as input

###List Comprehension -------------------Doubt
    Its a unique way to quickly create a list with python
    when using for loop along with .append() to create a list, List Comprehension is a good alternative
