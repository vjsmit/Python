So we know all these things are objects, so how can we create our own Object types? That is where the class keyword comes in.

class
User defined objects are created using the class keyword. The class is a blueprint that defines the nature of a future object. 
From classes we can construct instances. An instance is a specific object created from a particular class.


Inside of the class, we can define class attributes and methods.

An attribute is a characteristic of an object. A method is an operation we can perform with the object.

For example, we can create a class called Dog.
An attribute of a dog may be its breed or its name, while a method of a dog may be defined by a .bark() method which returns a sound.

Attributes
The syntax for creating an attribute is:

self.attribute = something

There is a special method __init__(), This method is used to initialize the attributes of an object.

Methods
Methods are functions defined inside the body of a class.
They are used to perform operations with the attributes of our objects.
Methods are a key concept of the OOP paradigm. They are essential to dividing responsibilities in programming, especially in large applications
