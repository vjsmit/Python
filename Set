Sets: set, unordered collection of unique objects: {"a","b"}
          There can be only one representative of same object
          
          student_set = set(student_list)
          print(student_set)

          student_set2 = set(['A', 'F', 'N', 'F', 'G', 'A'])
          print(student_set2)

          print(student_set2.intersection(student_set))
          print(student_set2.difference(student_set))
          print(student_set2.union(student_set))
         
Set-Comparison Methods:

.union() and .intersection()
A union is a new set that contains elements from all original sets. This can be thought of as the sum of two or more sets.
To create a union set, we simply use the .union() method from one set and supply a second set as the argument.
a = {1,2,3}
b = {3,4,5}
c = a.union(b)
print(c) # {1,2,3,4,5}

An intersection is a new set that contains only the elements from a that are also present in b.
Functionally, this includes the elements that overlap, or are in both sets.
Intersection identifies the common elements—or overlap—between multiple sets

a = {1,2,3}
b = {3,4,5}
c = a.intersection(b)
print(c) # {3}

.difference() and .symmetric_difference()
Difference identifies the values that exist in a base set and not in another
a = {1,2,3}
b = {3,4,5}
c = a.difference(b)
print(c) # {1,2}

a = {1,2,3}
b = {3,4,5}
c = b.difference(a)
print(c) # {4,5}

Symmetric difference identifies the unique elements across multiple sets
.symmetric_difference(). Think of this as the union minus the intersection.

a = {1,2,3}
b = {3,4,5}
c = a.symmetric_difference(b)
print(c) # {1,2,4,5}

.issubset() and .issuperset()
To validate whether one set fully exists within another.
Unlike the previous four methods, which returned new sets, the .issubset() and .issuperset() methods return boolean True or False values.
A subset is a set that entirely exists within another.
a = {1,2,3,4,5}
b = {3,4,5}
c = a.issubset(b) #Is a a subset of b?
print(c) # False

a = {1,2,3,4,5}
b = {3,4,5}
c = b.issubset(a)
print(c) # True

A superset is a set that includes every element (and potentially more) from another set
a = {1,2,3,4,5}
b = {3,4,5}
c = a.issuperset(b)
print(c) # True
