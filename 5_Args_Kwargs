Args & Kwargs.

These are functional parameters.
Arguments and KeyWord Arguments

To accept an arbitrary number of arguments and keyword args without having to predefined a bunch of parameters in our function calls.

we can pass the default parameters with value as 0. e.g. def my_func(a,b,c=0)

def my_func(*args): -----(It will allow us to treat this as a tuple)
 
**kwargs 
Same way we can have arbitrary no. of key worded arguments.
It will buids a dictionary of key value pairs.
